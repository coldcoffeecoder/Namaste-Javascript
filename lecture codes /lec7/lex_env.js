//whenever an execution context is created -> a lexical env is also created -->
//lexical env is the local memory along with the lexical env of its parent.

//lexical --> in a hiearchy or in a sequence

//in code terms --> 'c' function is lexically sitting inside 'a' function (check the code from scope.js)
